      <title>About Sana Client</title>

      <h2 style="color:black">When this first started, I wanted to make a Minecraft client that made that game run better for my friends at school so we could all be
better than the plebs using normal Minecraft. It all started with a command prompt launcher. 
To straight up fps boosters, OptiFine, Ram unlocks, Anti-Cheat, Download pages, audio because the version everyone had didn't give you audio.
And here we are now. All of this in under a year. I'm very proud of this. Just before I get any hate, 
this ofcourse was all for a cracked version of Minecraft because no-one in my school was actually going to buy an account. So yeah.

           Thank You     Sincerely - the Sana Client Devs

Pls no hate tho</h2>

      <h2 style="color:black">We got Optifine which basicly gives you more features and better fps</h2>
      <h2 style="color:black">-Ram Unlocker</h2>
      <h2 style="color:black">We use a command prompt line of code to start the java file with allowing there to be more ram</h2>
