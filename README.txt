  
When this first started, I wanted to make a Minecraft client that made that game run better for my friends at school so we could all be
better than the plebs using normal Minecraft. It started with a command prompt launcher. 
To straight up fps boosters, OptiFine, Ram unlocks, Anti-Cheat, Download pages, audio because the version everyone had didn't give u audio.
And here we are now. All of this in under a year. I'm very proud of this. Just before I get any hate, 
this was all for a cracked version of Minecraft because no-one in my school was actually going to buy an account. So yeah.
But its not our fault for Mojang for unintentionally making it unsecure. But I don't blame him. It must've been hard
           Thank You     Sincerely - the Sana Client Devs

Pls no hate tho
